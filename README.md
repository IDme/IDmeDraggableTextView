# IDmeDraggableTextView
A proof-of-concept on how to drag a TextView object into a WebView input/text field

## Background
This small project, developed in 2014, allows you to drag a TextView to any web input/text field. Upon doing so, the text in the TexView is transferred to the input/text field in the WebView.


## Note
This is a proof of concept. The code is offered *as-is* to be used freely in any project. 

No further updates are planned.

### Installation Instructions

This code is meant to be built upon. Drag the Activity into your Project and modify it for your project.
